# GalliGo Brand Guidelines
**Version 2.0 | React Native + Expo Edition | January 2026**

---

## Brand Overview

### Mission
GalliGo transforms how travelers discover and plan by turning trusted friend recommendations into living travel guides. We believe the best discoveries come from people who actually know you—not anonymous reviews or algorithms.

### Vision
Every traveler should have instant access to their friends' favorite places, organized and ready when wanderlust strikes. We're building a world where gallivanting—that playful, spontaneous exploration—is powered by your trusted network, not strangers or bots.

### Core Values

**Social Verification Over Star Ratings**
We trust friends over crowds. Your network's collective wisdom beats 10,000 anonymous reviews every time. When three friends love a coffee shop, you know you'll love it too.

**Authentic Connection**
We celebrate real moments, real recommendations, and real friendships. No influencer polish, no fake reviews, no performative travel. Just genuine discoveries shared between people who know each other.

**Effortless Organization**
Travel planning shouldn't require spreadsheet PhDs. We make it as simple as texting a friend "where should I eat in Tokyo?" but with all the answers instantly organized and saved forever.

**Gallivanting Spirit**
Travel isn't just annual two-week vacations. It's weekend getaways, spontaneous day trips, local exploration, and frequent micro-adventures. We support the lifestyle traveler who's always planning the next escape.

### Brand Personality

GalliGo embodies the perfect blend of **Enthusiastic Curator** and **Organized Planner**—like that knowledgeable friend who not only discovers hidden gems but actually remembers to share the address.

**The Enthusiastic Curator (60%)**
- Excited about discovery and sharing unique finds
- Curious, adventurous, wonder-filled
- Celebrates authentic experiences over tourist traps
- "You HAVE to check out this place!"

**The Organized Planner (40%)**
- Structured, reliable, helps you actually follow through
- Never forgets a recommendation
- Makes planning feel effortless not overwhelming
- "I've got everything organized for you"

**We Are:**
- A well-traveled friend texting you recommendations
- Knowledgeable but never pretentious
- Genuinely helpful, not just enthusiastic
- Excited but grounded in practicality

**We Are NOT:**
- A corporate travel booking engine
- An AI assistant spouting generic suggestions
- A social media flex platform
- A review aggregator drowning you in options

### Target Audience

**Primary: Young Professionals (25-35)**
- Travel frequently (4+ trips/year including weekends)
- Multiple friend groups (college, work, hobbies, weddings)
- Active on social media but tired of performative travel content
- Value authentic recommendations over star ratings
- Juggle planning trips with busy work schedules
- Suffer from choice paralysis when researching destinations
- Constantly texting friends "what was that place you mentioned?"

**Psychographic Profile:**
- **Lifestyle Travelers**: See travel as ongoing lifestyle, not just vacations
- **Socially Connected**: Strong friend networks, trust personal recommendations
- **Authenticity Seekers**: Tired of fake reviews and influencer-perfect Instagram
- **Organization-Challenged**: Want to save recommendations but lose them in message threads
- **Discovery-Driven**: Prefer hidden gems over touristy attractions

**Pain Points We Solve:**
- Forgetting friend recommendations after casual conversations
- Drowning in anonymous TripAdvisor reviews with no context
- Endless research leading to decision paralysis
- Copying/pasting recommendations from text threads to Google Docs
- Not knowing which friends have been to your destination
- Coordinating group trip planning across scattered platforms

### Positioning Statement

**For lifestyle travelers tired of fake reviews and generic recommendations, GalliGo is the only travel app that shows you places your actual friends love—turning trusted recommendations into instant trip plans. Unlike TripAdvisor's anonymous strangers, Google's impersonal algorithms, or Polarsteps' documentation focus, GalliGo provides social verification from your trusted network across all travel experiences—restaurants, hotels, activities, and hidden gems.**

### Photography Style: Analog Authenticity

GalliGo's signature aesthetic embraces **analog film photography**—warm, grainy, candid moments that feel genuine and unfiltered. We're the anti-Instagram perfection.

**Core Aesthetic Principles:**

**1. Film Grain Texture**
- Apply medium 35mm film grain overlay at 20-40% opacity
- Use authentic scans (Kodak Portra, Fuji Pro 400H references)
- Subtle enough to add warmth without obscuring detail
- Grain adds intimacy and nostalgia across generations

**2. Warm Color Grading**
- Golden hour color temperature (3000-4000K)
- Slight fade in shadows (lifted blacks)
- Boosted luminance in warm colors (oranges, yellows, reds)
- Muted saturation overall for film feel
- Preserve Galli Blue in skies, water, clothing

**3. Candid, Unposed Moments**
- NO staged poses or direct camera eye contact
- Capture people engaged in activities, not "modeling"
- Embrace imperfection: motion blur, genuine laughter, unguarded expressions
- Mid-action shots showing real experiences
- Environmental context showing location

**4. Companionship Focus**
- 2-5 person friend groups optimal
- Physical closeness: linked arms, heads together, touching naturally
- Genuine interactions: talking, laughing, exploring together
- Avoid single hero shots—emphasize "we" over "me"

**5. Golden Hour Lighting**
- Signature lighting: Warm sunset/sunrise glow
- Soft, flattering shadows
- Natural lens flare acceptable
- Backlit silhouettes with rim light
- Aim for 70% of photos shot during golden hour

**Subject Matter Guidelines:**

**People (60% of imagery)**
- Friend groups walking together, arms linked
- Genuine laughter over shared meals
- Exploring markets, touching produce, interacting with environment
- Mid-adventure: hiking, jumping, dancing, running
- Quiet moments: conversations, heads close together
- Diverse representation: ages, abilities, body types, ethnicities

**Places (25% of imagery)**
- Hidden corners with character and texture
- Local markets, street scenes with cultural context
- Architectural details showing human scale
- Mix of wide establishing shots and intimate details
- Environmental storytelling—show WHERE they are

**Food & Experiences (15% of imagery)**
- Communal dining, sharing plates
- Hands reaching for food (action, not static plating)
- Overhead and side angles showing environment
- Natural lighting, authentic settings
- Behind-the-scenes moments

**Composition Techniques:**

**Rule of Thirds**
- Place subjects on grid intersections
- Horizon on upper or lower third line
- Create visual interest, not centered symmetry

**Leading Lines**
- Use streets, bridges, paths to draw eye to subjects
- Natural frames: doorways, windows, foliage
- Depth through foreground/background elements

**Environmental Context (60% of photos)**
- Show location elements that tell where you are
- Include landmarks, architecture, cultural markers
- Balance subject isolation with place context

**Action & Movement (70% of photos)**
- People doing things more interesting than standing
- Walking, exploring, interacting, discovering
- Conveys adventure and exploration mindset

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Influencer-perfect poses and styling
- ❌ Heavy filters or Instagram presets
- ❌ Stock photography aesthetics
- ❌ Overly polished, studio-lit scenes
- ❌ Solo hero shots of "perfect" travelers
- ❌ Tourist attraction clichés (jumping at Eiffel Tower)
- ❌ Food styled for magazines (too perfect)

**Technical Specifications:**
- Shoot RAW for maximum color grading flexibility
- Minimum resolution: 2048px wide for digital use
- Apply grain overlays in post (35mm medium grain, Screen/Overlay blend mode)
- Color grade template: Warm midtones +15, lift blacks slightly, preserve Galli Blue
- Export at 85% JPEG quality for optimal file size

### Motion & Animation

**React Native Framework**
GalliGo is built on React Native 0.81.5 with Expo, using native iOS animations that feel fluid and responsive.

**Animation Library: react-native-reanimated v4**
- Runs animations on UI thread (60fps guaranteed)
- Gesture-driven interactions with react-native-gesture-handler
- Native performance, JavaScript API

**iOS Animation Standards**

All animations follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for consistent, predictable motion:

**Standard Durations (Native UIView Timing)**
- **Navigation Push/Pop:** 350ms (UINavigationController standard)
- **Modal Present:** 440ms (iOS sheet presentation)
- **Modal Dismiss:** 320ms (iOS sheet dismissal)
- **Tab Switch:** 250ms (UITabBarController)
- **Button Press:** 200-300ms (haptic + visual feedback)
- **Micro-interactions:** 150-200ms (toggles, checkmarks)

**iOS Easing Curves (UIView.AnimationOptions)**
- **Default:** easeInOut (0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0) - Most transitions
- **Smooth Entry:** easeOut (0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0) - Content appearing
- **Smooth Exit:** easeIn (0.4, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0) - Content disappearing
- **Spring Physics:** damping: 0.86, stiffness: 250 (iOS native spring)

**React Native Implementation**

```typescript
// Native iOS timing with react-native-reanimated
import { withTiming, withSpring } from 'react-native-reanimated';

// Navigation transition (350ms, easeInOut)
const navTransition = withTiming(targetValue, {
  duration: 350,
  easing: Easing.bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0)
});

// Modal presentation (440ms, easeOut)
const modalPresent = withTiming(1, {
  duration: 440,
  easing: Easing.out(Easing.ease)
});

// iOS spring (native feel)
const springAnimation = withSpring(targetValue, {
  damping: 20,      // iOS damping: 0.86 → 20 (reanimated scale)
  stiffness: 250,   // iOS stiffness
  mass: 1
});
```

**Key Animation Patterns**

**1. Heart "Save" Animation**
```typescript
// Smooth scale + haptic feedback
withSpring(1.2, { damping: 15 }, () => {
  withTiming(1.0, { duration: 200 });
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium);
});
```

**2. Sheet Modal (iOS Native)**
```typescript
// Bottom sheet presentation
Animated.timing(translateY, {
  toValue: 0,
  duration: 440,
  easing: Easing.out(Easing.ease),
  useNativeDriver: true
}).start();
```

**3. List Item Swipe Actions**
```typescript
// Gesture-driven with react-native-gesture-handler
const gesture = Gesture.Pan()
  .onUpdate((e) => {
    translateX.value = e.translationX;
  })
  .onEnd(() => {
    translateX.value = withSpring(0);
  });
```

**4. Success Checkmark**
```typescript
// Scale + opacity sequence
withSequence(
  withTiming(1.2, { duration: 150 }),
  withTiming(1.0, { duration: 150 }),
  withDelay(500, withTiming(0, { duration: 200 }))
);
```

**Principles:**
- Subtle, purposeful motion—never gratuitous
- Use iOS native timing for familiarity
- Respect reduced motion preferences (iOS Accessibility)
- All animations run on UI thread (60fps smooth)
- Gesture-driven interactions feel immediate
- Celebrate key moments with gentle animation

**Native iOS Gestures**
- Swipe-to-delete: Standard iOS pattern
- Pull-to-refresh: Native iOS behavior
- Bottom sheet drag: iOS modal interaction
- Tab bar haptics: Native feedback on tap

**Accessibility:**
- Respect `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled`
- Provide instant state changes when motion is reduced
- Never require motion to convey critical information
- Keep animations under 5 seconds
- All transitions have static alternatives

**Performance:**
- Use `useNativeDriver: true` for transform/opacity animations
- Avoid animating layout properties (width, height) when possible
- Offload to UI thread with reanimated worklets
- Test on real iOS devices (not just simulator)
- Target 60fps (16.67ms per frame)

## Technical Implementation

### React Native + Expo Architecture

**Core Stack**
- **Framework:** React Native 0.81.5
- **Workflow:** Expo Managed (~54.0.23) with development builds
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **UI Library:** React 19.1.0
- **Navigation:** React Navigation v7 (Bottom Tabs + Stack)
- **State Management:** TanStack Query + Zustand
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Express API

**Native iOS Build**
```bash
# Development workflow
npx expo start --dev-client

# Rebuild when adding native modules
npx expo run:ios --device "iPhone-16-Pro-Simulator"
```

**Styling Approach**

**React Native StyleSheet + NativeWind (Tailwind)**
```typescript
// Prefer StyleSheet for performance-critical components
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#FAFAFA',
    paddingHorizontal: 16
  }
});

// NativeWind for rapid prototyping
<View className="flex-1 bg-off-white px-4" />
```

**Design Tokens in JavaScript**
```typescript
// tokens.ts
export const colors = {
  galliBlue: '#00DDFF',
  sunsetOrange: '#FF6347',
  offWhite: '#FAFAFA',
  charcoal: '#2C2C2C'
};

export const spacing = {
  xs: 4,
  sm: 8,
  md: 16,
  lg: 24,
  xl: 32
};

export const typography = {
  headline: {
    fontFamily: 'Outfit-SemiBold',
    fontSize: 28,
    lineHeight: 36
  },
  body: {
    fontFamily: 'Roboto-Regular',
    fontSize: 16,
    lineHeight: 24
  }
};
```

**React Native Components**

All UI uses React Native primitives (not web HTML):
- `View` (not `<div>`)
- `Text` (not `<span>` or `<p>`)
- `Pressable` (not `<button>`)
- `ScrollView` (not `<div>` with overflow)
- `Image` (not `<img>`)
- `TextInput` (not `<input>`)

**iOS-Specific Considerations**

**Safe Area Handling**
```typescript
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

<SafeAreaView edges={['top', 'bottom']}>
  {/* Content automatically respects notch/home indicator */}
</SafeAreaView>
```

**Platform-Specific Code**
```typescript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const shadowStyle = Platform.select({
  ios: {
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowOpacity: 0.1,
    shadowRadius: 4
  },
  android: {
    elevation: 4
  }
});
```

**Haptic Feedback**
```typescript
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics';

// On button press
Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium);

// On success
Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success);
```

**Native Modules Used**
- **expo-location:** GPS tracking for nearby places
- **expo-image-picker:** Photo uploads for place reviews
- **expo-secure-store:** Encrypted storage for auth tokens
- **expo-haptics:** Touch feedback
- **react-native-maps:** Apple Maps integration for iOS
- **react-native-reanimated:** High-performance animations
- **react-native-gesture-handler:** Native gesture recognition

    fontWeight: '600'
  },
  primaryText: {
    color: '#FFFFFF'
  },
  secondaryText: {
    color: colors.galliBlue
  }
});
```

### Maps Integration

**react-native-maps (Apple Maps on iOS)**

```typescript
import MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps';

<MapView
  style={{ flex: 1 }}
  initialRegion={{
    latitude: 37.7749,
    longitude: -122.4194,
    latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
    longitudeDelta: 0.0421
  }}
  showsUserLocation
  showsMyLocationButton
  mapType="standard"  // Apple Maps style
>
  {places.map(place => (
    <Marker
      key={place.id}
      coordinate={{
        latitude: place.latitude,
        longitude: place.longitude
      }}
      title={place.name}
      description={`${place.friendCount} friends have been here`}
    />
  ))}
</MapView>
```

**Custom Marker Icons**
- Heart icon (saved places): Galli Blue filled heart
- Friend markers: Profile photo with subtle border
- Multiple friends: Stacked avatars (max 3)
- New places: Badge with "New!" indicator

### Performance Optimization

**Image Optimization**
```typescript
import { Image } from 'expo-image';

// Use expo-image for automatic optimization
<Image
  source={{ uri: photo.url }}
  style={{ width: '100%', height: 200 }}
  contentFit="cover"
  placeholder={blurhash}  // Smooth loading
  transition={200}        // Native fade-in
/>
```

**List Performance (FlatList)**
```typescript
import { FlatList } from 'react-native';

<FlatList
  data={places}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <PlaceCard place={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  windowSize={5}                    // Render 5 screens worth
  removeClippedSubviews             // Unmount off-screen items
  maxToRenderPerBatch={10}          // Batch rendering
  updateCellsBatchingPeriod={50}    // 50ms batching
  initialNumToRender={10}           // First 10 items immediately
/>
```

**State Management**
```typescript
// TanStack Query for server state
const { data: trips, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['trips'],
  queryFn: fetchTrips
});

// Zustand for client state
const useAppStore = create((set) => ({
  selectedTrip: null,
  setSelectedTrip: (trip) => set({ selectedTrip: trip })
}));
```

## App Icon Design

### iOS Icon Requirements

**Technical Specifications**
- 1024×1024px PNG (App Store submission)
- Must remain clear from 29×29px (notification) to 1024×1024px
- No transparency—solid opaque background required
- Works in light mode, dark mode, and tinted modes

**GalliGo Icon Direction**
- **Focal Point:** Single centered element capturing social travel essence
- **Simplicity:** Recognizable at smallest sizes, minimal detail
- **Color:** Galli Blue (#00DDFF) primary with warm accent
- **Style:** Geometric but friendly, rounded not rigid
- **Concept:** Abstract representation of connected discovery (not literal logo)

**Design Approach**
- Centered location pin with subtle friend network connections
- Galli Blue background with gradient to warm coral
- Rounded geometric shapes maintaining brand friendliness
- Works at all iOS sizes (including home screen, notifications, settings)

**iOS Adaptive Icon**
- Standard (light mode): Full color version
- Dark mode: Slightly lighter variant for visibility
- Tinted: Monochrome version respecting system tint

**What to Avoid:**
- No screenshots or interface mockups
- No text (unreadable at small sizes)
- No photographic content (loses clarity)
- No Apple hardware replicas
- No generic travel clichés (airplane, globe silhouettes)

---

## Empty States

### Structure (Kinneret Yifrah Framework)

**Components:**
1. **Heading:** State what's missing (16-18px, Medium weight)
2. **Explanation:** Why it matters or how to fix (14px, Regular)
3. **Action:** Clear CTA button (prominent, 48px touch target)
4. **Visual:** Simple illustration matching brand tone

**React Native Implementation**

```typescript
// components/EmptyState.tsx
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms/Button';

interface EmptyStateProps {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  actionLabel: string;
  onAction: () => void;
  illustration?: React.ReactNode;
}

export const EmptyState: React.FC<EmptyStateProps> = ({
  title,
  description,
  actionLabel,
  onAction,
  illustration
}) => (
  <View style={styles.container}>
    {illustration && <View style={styles.illustration}>{illustration}</View>}
    <Text style={styles.title}>{title}</Text>
    <Text style={styles.description}>{description}</Text>
    <Button title={actionLabel} onPress={onAction} />
  </View>
);

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    paddingHorizontal: 32
  },
  illustration: {
    marginBottom: 24
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: '500',
    color: colors.charcoal,
    marginBottom: 8,
    textAlign: 'center'
  },
  description: {
    fontSize: 14,
    color: colors.mediumGray,
    marginBottom: 24,
    textAlign: 'center',
    lineHeight: 20
  }
});
```

**GalliGo Empty State Examples:**

**No Trips Yet**
```typescript
<EmptyState
  title="Your trip board is ready to fill"
  description="Save places as you discover them and build itineraries with friends."
  actionLabel="Start Exploring"
  onAction={() => navigation.navigate('Explore')}
  illustration={<MapPinIllustration />}
/>
```

**No Friends Connected**
```typescript
<EmptyState
  title="Travel is better with friends"
  description="Connect to see where they've been and share your favorite discoveries."
  actionLabel="Find Friends"
  onAction={() => navigation.navigate('AddFriends')}
  illustration={<FriendsIllustration />}
/>
```

**No Saved Places**
```typescript
<EmptyState
  title="Your saved places will live here"
  description="When you find spots you love, tap the heart to save them for later."
  actionLabel="Explore Places"
  onAction={() => navigation.navigate('Discover')}
  illustration={<HeartIllustration />}
/>
```

---

## Error Handling

### Native iOS Error Patterns

**Alert (iOS Native)**
```typescript
import { Alert } from 'react-native';

// Connection error
Alert.alert(
  "Connection Issue",
  "Hmm, we can't connect right now. Check your internet and try again.",
  [
    { text: "Try Again", onPress: retryAction }
  ]
);
```

**Toast Notification (Custom)**
```typescript
// components/Toast.tsx
import { Animated, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics';

export const showToast = (message: string, type: 'success' | 'error') => {
  Haptics.notificationAsync(
    type === 'success' 
      ? Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success
      : Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Error
  );
  
  // Animated toast implementation...
};
```

**GalliGo Error Examples:**

**Permission Denied**
```typescript
Alert.alert(
  "Location Access Needed",
  "We need location access to show nearby places. You can enable this in Settings > Privacy > Location Services > GalliGo.",
  [
    { text: "Cancel", style: "cancel" },
    { text: "Open Settings", onPress: () => Linking.openSettings() }
  ]
);
```

**Save Failed**
```typescript
showToast("That didn't save. Make sure you're connected and try again.", 'error');
```

**Load Failed**
```typescript
Alert.alert(
  "Couldn't Load Trip",
  "It may have been deleted, or you don't have access. Try refreshing or check with who shared it.",
  [
    { text: "Refresh", onPress: refreshAction }
  ]
);
```

---

## Onboarding Flow

### React Navigation Implementation

**Onboarding Stack (Modal)**
```typescript
// navigation/OnboardingStack.tsx
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export const OnboardingStack = () => (
  <Stack.Navigator
    screenOptions={{
      headerShown: false,
      presentation: 'modal',
      animationEnabled: true,
      gestureEnabled: false  // Prevent dismissal mid-onboarding
    }}
  >
    <Stack.Screen name="Welcome" component={WelcomeScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="Discovery" component={DiscoveryScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="Planning" component={PlanningScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="QuickRecs" component={QuickRecsScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="Permissions" component={PermissionsScreen} />
  </Stack.Navigator>
);
```

**Swipeable Carousel (Native Gesture)**
```typescript
import { Animated, ScrollView, Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width } = Dimensions.get('window');

<ScrollView
  horizontal
  pagingEnabled
  showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
  onScroll={Animated.event(
    [{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { x: scrollX } } }],
    { useNativeDriver: true }
  )}
>
  {screens.map((screen, index) => (
    <View key={index} style={{ width }}>
      {screen}
    </View>
  ))}
</ScrollView>
```

**Permission Request (Pre-Permission Pattern)**
```typescript
import * as Location from 'expo-location';

const requestLocationPermission = async () => {
  const { status } = await Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync();
  
  if (status === 'granted') {
    showToast('Location enabled!', 'success');
  } else {
    Alert.alert(
      "Location Disabled",
      "You can enable location later in Settings.",
      [{ text: "OK" }]
    );
  }
};
```

---

## Notification Copy

### Expo Notifications

**Push Notification Setup**
```typescript
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

// Configure handler
Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true,
    shouldPlaySound: true,
    shouldSetBadge: true
  })
});

// Send notification
await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "New Recs from Sarah",
    body: "You have 5 new recs for Berlin from friends!",
    data: { screen: 'TripDetail', tripId: '123' }
  },
  trigger: null  // Immediate
});
```

**Deep Linking**
```typescript
// Handle notification tap
Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener((response) => {
  const { screen, tripId } = response.notification.request.content.data;
  navigation.navigate(screen, { id: tripId });
});
```

**Notification Library (20-90 characters)**

**Friend Activity**
- "Sarah just saved a coffee shop in Tokyo you'd love" (56 chars)
- "3 friends have been to Barcelona—ask them for recs!" (53 chars)
- "Maya added 2 places to your shared trip" (41 chars)

**Recommendation Responses**
- "You have 5 new recs for Berlin from friends!" (47 chars)
- "Emma shared her top 3 restaurants in Paris with you" (53 chars)
- "Friends responded to your rec request for dinner" (50 chars)

**Trip Reminders**
- "Your Barcelona trip starts in 3 days—everything ready?" (57 chars)
- "Check-in opens in 24 hours for your flight to Tokyo" (53 chars)

**Group Trip Updates**
- "Alex just voted on dinner options for your group trip" (55 chars)
- "Your group decided on La Paella for Friday night" (50 chars)
- "2 new friends joined your Tokyo trip planning" (47 chars)

## Competitive Differentiation

### How GalliGo is NOT Like Competitors

**vs. TripAdvisor (Anonymous Reviews)**

**Their Problem:**
- Fake reviews epidemic (1 in 7 reviews shows "blatant hallmarks" of fakery)
- Anonymous strangers rating places
- No context about who's reviewing
- 10,000 reviews but which ones matter to YOU?

**GalliGo's Difference:**
- **Every recommendation comes from someone you know and trust**
- "Sarah loved this" beats "4.2 stars from 843 strangers"
- See which friends have been, when, what they thought
- Social accountability—no fake reviews from friends

**Messaging:**
- "Recommendations from friends, not randoms"
- "Know who's behind every recommendation"
- "Your friends' favorites, not strangers' opinions"

---

**vs. Google Travel (Algorithmic Recommendations)**

**Their Problem:**
- Algorithm guesses based on patterns from people you don't know
- "People like you" not "People you know"
- Impersonal, one-size-fits-all recommendations
- No emotional connection or trust

**GalliGo's Difference:**
- **Friends who know your actual taste, not bots guessing preferences**
- Personal curation beats pattern matching
- Context matters—friends know you hate crowds, love outdoor seating
- Human connection over machine learning

**Messaging:**
- "Curated by friends, not algorithms"
- "Personal recommendations, not pattern matching"
- "Your network > Their algorithm"
- "Friends who know you, not bots guessing"

---

**vs. Airbnb (Accommodations-Focused)**

**Their Problem:**
- Solves WHERE to stay
- Doesn't help with WHAT to do, WHERE to eat, HOW to spend time
- Limited to lodging discovery

**GalliGo's Difference:**
- **Full travel experience: restaurants, activities, sights, neighborhoods, hotels**
- Friend recommendations across all categories
- Beyond the bed—find the experiences
- Complete trip discovery, not just accommodations

**Messaging:**
- "Beyond where to sleep—discover where to go"
- "Airbnb finds you a bed, we find you an experience"
- "Complete trip discovery from trusted friends"

**Positioning:** GalliGo complements Airbnb—use both together for complete trip

---

**vs. Polarsteps (Travel Documentation)**

**Their Problem:**
- Focus on tracking and documenting journeys AFTER travel
- GPS-tracking emphasis
- Travel books and memories (looking back)
- Doesn't solve discovery or planning

**GalliGo's Difference:**
- **Solves discovery and planning BEFORE/DURING travel**
- Friend recommendations drive decisions
- "What should I do?" not "What did I do?"
- Living travel guide, not digital scrapbook

**Messaging:**
- "Plan your next trip with friends' recommendations"
- "Discover before you go, not just document after"
- "Forward-looking discovery, not backward documentation"

---

**vs. Beli (Restaurant-Only Focus)**

**Their Problem:**
- Restaurants only—massive limitation
- Doesn't solve hotels, activities, sights, neighborhoods
- Gamified ranking can feel like work
- Becoming influencer-heavy

**GalliGo's Difference:**
- **All travel categories: food, stays, activities, everything**
- Simple saving and sharing, not forced ranking
- Authentic recommendations, anti-influencer
- Complete travel discovery

**Messaging:**
- "Beyond restaurants—discover complete travel experiences"
- "Everything you need, not just where to eat"
- "Full trip planning from trusted friends"

## Do's and Don'ts

### Voice & Copy

**DO:**
✅ Write like a knowledgeable friend texting recommendations
✅ Use contractions consistently (you're, we'll, here's)
✅ Lead with benefits, not features
✅ Be specific: "3 friends love this coffee shop" not "Popular place"
✅ Use active voice: "Sarah recommended" not "Was recommended by Sarah"
✅ Celebrate small wins: "Saved! You've got great taste"
✅ Keep buttons to 2-3 words max
✅ Use second person: "Your trips" or first person: "My trips" (pick one per context)

**DON'T:**
❌ Use corporate jargon: utilize, leverage, optimize, implement
❌ Mix first and second person: NOT "View your account in My Settings"
❌ Be overly enthusiastic: Multiple exclamation points!!
❌ Use generic CTAs: "Click here," "Learn more," "Submit"
❌ Write long sentences in microcopy (under 8 words ideal)
❌ Use passive voice: "Your trip has been saved"
❌ Say "error" or "failed"—use "hmm" or "couldn't"

### React Native Development

**DO:**
✅ Use React Native primitives (View, Text, Pressable, etc.)
✅ Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines for spacing, typography, touch targets
✅ Use StyleSheet for performance-critical components
✅ Test on real iOS devices (not just simulator)
✅ Implement haptic feedback for all interactive elements
✅ Support iOS Dynamic Type for accessibility
✅ Use useNativeDriver: true for animations
✅ Follow 48×48px minimum touch target size

**DON'T:**
❌ Use web HTML elements (<div>, <button>, <span>)
❌ Use CSS for styling (use StyleSheet or NativeWind)
❌ Ignore safe area insets (notch, home indicator)
❌ Create touch targets smaller than 44×44px
❌ Animate layout properties when avoidable
❌ Skip testing on physical devices
❌ Use arbitrary timing (follow iOS standards)
❌ Forget to handle iOS permissions properly

### Visual Identity

**DO:**
✅ Use Galli Blue (#00DDFF) on dark backgrounds for text
✅ Apply film grain overlay (35mm medium, 20-40% opacity)
✅ Warm color grading with golden hour tones
✅ Capture candid, unposed moments
✅ Show 2-5 person friend groups with physical closeness
✅ Include environmental context in 60% of photos
✅ Shoot during golden hour for 70% of photos
✅ Embrace imperfection: motion blur, genuine laughter
✅ Use white text ON Galli Blue backgrounds

**DON'T:**
❌ Use cyan text on white backgrounds (fails contrast)
❌ Over-filter or Instagram-polish photos
❌ Stage posed influencer-style shots
❌ Show solo hero shots constantly—emphasize "we" over "me"
❌ Use stock photography aesthetics
❌ Photograph tourist attraction clichés
❌ Over-style food to magazine perfection
❌ Skip film grain—it's core to brand aesthetic

### Animation & Motion

**DO:**
✅ Follow iOS native timing (350ms nav, 440ms modal present)
✅ Use iOS easing curves (easeInOut, easeOut, easeIn)
✅ Convert iOS spring physics properly (damping, stiffness)
✅ Run animations on UI thread with reanimated
✅ Respect reduced motion preferences
✅ Add haptic feedback for all interactions
✅ Target 60fps (16.67ms per frame)
✅ Test gesture interactions thoroughly

**DON'T:**
❌ Use arbitrary timing values (follow iOS standards)
❌ Use web animation libraries (Framer Motion, etc.)
❌ Animate layout properties when avoidable
❌ Ignore reduced motion accessibility setting
❌ Skip haptic feedback on interactions
❌ Create janky animations (use useNativeDriver)
❌ Forget to test on real devices
❌ Make animations longer than 5 seconds

---

## Accessibility Guidelines

### WCAG 2.1 Level AA + iOS Accessibility

**iOS Dynamic Type Support**
```typescript
import { Text, StyleSheet, useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font';

// Text automatically scales with iOS accessibility settings
<Text
  style={styles.body}
  adjustsFontSizeToFit
  minimumFontScale={0.8}
  maxFontSizeMultiplier={2}  // Limit scaling to 2x
>
  Body text that respects user preferences
</Text>

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  body: {
    fontSize: 16,
    lineHeight: 24,
    fontFamily: 'Roboto-Regular'
  }
});
```

**VoiceOver (iOS Screen Reader)**
```typescript
<Pressable
  accessible
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityLabel="Save place to your favorites"
  accessibilityHint="Double tap to add this place to your saved list"
  onPress={savePlce}
>
  <Icon name="heart" />
</Pressable>
```

**Color Contrast (Critical for #00DDFF)**
- Normal text: 4.5:1 minimum
- Large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold): 3:1 minimum
- UI components: 3:1 minimum
- **Galli Blue Implementation:**
  - ✅ Use on dark backgrounds (charcoal, navy, black)
  - ✅ Use white text ON cyan backgrounds
  - ❌ Never use cyan text on white/light backgrounds

**Touch Targets (iOS HIG)**
- Primary actions: 48×48px minimum
- Secondary actions: 44×44px minimum (iOS HIG standard)
- Spacing between targets: 8px minimum

**Reduced Motion**
```typescript
import { AccessibilityInfo } from 'react-native';

const [reduceMotionEnabled, setReduceMotionEnabled] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled().then(setReduceMotionEnabled);
}, []);

// Conditionally apply animations
const animatedValue = useSharedValue(0);

if (reduceMotionEnabled) {
  animatedValue.value = 1;  // Instant
} else {
  animatedValue.value = withSpring(1);  // Animated
}
```

**Alternative Text for Images**
```typescript
<Image
  source={{ uri: photo.url }}
  accessibilityLabel="Tokyo: Friends sharing ramen at street-side counter during golden hour"
  accessible
/>
```

---

## Localization Guidelines

### React Native i18n

**i18n Setup (expo-localization)**
```typescript
import * as Localization from 'expo-localization';
import { I18n } from 'i18n-js';

const translations = {
  en: {
    welcome: 'Welcome to GalliGo!',
    savePlace: 'Save Place'
  },
  es: {
    welcome: '¡Bienvenido a GalliGo!',
    savePlace: 'Guardar Lugar'
  }
};

const i18n = new I18n(translations);
i18n.locale = Localization.locale;
i18n.enableFallback = true;

// Usage
<Text>{i18n.t('welcome')}</Text>
```

**RTL Language Support**
```typescript
import { I18nManager } from 'react-native';

// Force RTL for Arabic, Hebrew
if (locale === 'ar' || locale === 'he') {
  I18nManager.forceRTL(true);
}

// Mirror layouts automatically
<View style={{ flexDirection: 'row' }}>
  {/* Automatically reverses in RTL */}
</View>
```

**Date/Time Formatting**
```typescript
import * as Localization from 'expo-localization';

const formatDate = (date: Date) => {
  return new Intl.DateTimeFormat(Localization.locale, {
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric',
    year: 'numeric'
  }).format(date);
};

// Output: "December 31, 2024" (en-US)
// Output: "31 de diciembre de 2024" (es-ES)
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### React Native Best Practices

**Optimize Re-renders**
```typescript
import { memo, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';

// Memoize components
export const PlaceCard = memo<PlaceCardProps>(({ place }) => {
  // Component implementation
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => prevProps.place.id === nextProps.place.id);

// Memoize callbacks
const handlePress = useCallback(() => {
  navigation.navigate('PlaceDetail', { id: place.id });
}, [place.id, navigation]);

// Memoize expensive calculations
const sortedPlaces = useMemo(() => {
  return places.sort((a, b) => b.rating - a.rating);
}, [places]);
```

**FlatList Optimization**
```typescript
<FlatList
  data={places}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <PlaceCard place={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  windowSize={5}                    // Render 5 screens worth
  removeClippedSubviews             // Unmount off-screen items (iOS)
  maxToRenderPerBatch={10}          // Batch rendering
  updateCellsBatchingPeriod={50}    // 50ms batching
  initialNumToRender={10}           // First 10 immediately
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
    length: 100,
    offset: 100 * index,
    index
  })}  // If items have fixed height
/>
```

**Image Optimization (expo-image)**
```typescript
import { Image } from 'expo-image';

<Image
  source={{ uri: photo.url }}
  style={{ width: '100%', height: 200 }}
  contentFit="cover"
  placeholder={blurhash}      // Blurhash placeholder
  placeholderContentFit="cover"
  transition={200}            // Native fade-in
  cachePolicy="memory-disk"   // Cache strategy
  priority="high"             // Loading priority
/>
```
